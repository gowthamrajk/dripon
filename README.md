# DRIPON

- It is  a retrofit for healthcare bottles used in the hospitals to control the flow of drips automatically.
- when th nurse from the nurse station fails to monitor the drips of patients, our product gives an system alert and audio alert at various stages to the nurses and as a message to the patients as ( 25%,50%,75%) of completions. 
- when the limit comes below few ml, our product gives a final alert to the nurses as well as the caretakers and then automatically turns off the flow of drips in order to stop the reverse blood flow and air bubble formation in the blodd vessels which can end in severe heart attack.
